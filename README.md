# Features

## Responsive Navigation Bar
The menu appears in its full form and collapses into a mobile friendly version when the screen size is reduced to 480 pixels.
This helps with navigation on smaller devices. Users have access to information about Marketing Association, the services on offer and a list of contacts.
